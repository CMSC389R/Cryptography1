# Cryptography1
First Cryptography assignment for my Intro to Ethical Hacking Course at the University of Maryland

## Part 1

#### 1. What is the hashing algorithm(s) used to secure these passwords?


#### 2. What salt is used for these passwords, if any?


#### 3. When were the passwords changed, if at all?


#### 4. What are the restrictions each user has on changing their password, if any?


#### 5. Have any passwords expired? If so, whose?

#### 6. Use one of the tools discussed in class (hashcat, JohnTheRipper) to try and recover each password and show how you used the tool.
